# Joypad_jog_speed.hal 
#
# This file is an example .hal for control of the halui jog speed using a hal_input device.
# This was tested with a Logitech F310.
#
# This file connects three buttons to choose maximum jog speed in axis and joint modes.
# Add this file to postgui_call_list.hal using a line with "source Joypad_jog_speed.hal".
# Add another file (joypad_xyz.hal or joypad_xy.hal) to link the joysticks values to achieve motion.

# Using Joypad buttons to set the speeds
#
# This feature makes the joypad safer to use as you must hold a speed selection button while jogging.

# Set the jog speed for the joypad speed selection. Use numbers that make sense for your machine.
#
setp mux4.0.in0 0.0   # Setting this input to 0 prevents motion unless one of the other buttons is pressed.
setp mux4.0.in1 30.0  # Max jog speed when first speed select button is pressed.
setp mux4.0.in2 300.0 # Max jog speed when second speed select button is pressed.
setp mux4.0.in3 900.0 # Max jog speed when third speed select button is pressed.
#
# The following lines do the magic of setting the jog speed selection. You must hold at least one of the buttons while jogging.
# Notice this does not fully decode the button possibilities. If you simultaneously press multiple buttons you will get the higher speed.
