Two things I use with my Linux boxes (all of them, not just CNC) is enable ssh and install samba file sharing.

SSH (lets you open a command shell from your windows computer to run commands on the linux machine) From https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-enable-ssh-on-debian

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install openssh-server
sudo systemctl status ssh


Samba From https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-set-up-a-samba-server-on-debian-10-buster

sudo apt install samba
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf


edit /etc/samba/smb.conf to share the linuxcnc directory.
[CNChome]
    comment = Home on Debian CNC box.
    path = /home/cncbox/linuxcnc
    browseable = yes
    read only = no
    guest ok = yes
    available = yes
    public = yes
    writeable = yes
    valid users = cncbox
